I don't know what I want to do here, but I feel like I could definitely do something fun, idk
- Wordle for Greek letters - ωορδle? Ϝορδle? λέξηle or λέξηκle?
- Wordle with Linear B https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~crypto/Projects/ElizabethSmit/linear_b.html - neat but seems complicated.
- Olympic Games game somehow
- Minotaur's labyrinth
- Something to do with Greek math
- Greek gods
- Euclid's Elements Visualizations

For Proposition 2:
Need to 
1. extend a line in a direction
2. Get intersections between lines and arcs (and perhaps lines and lines)

TODO
- add seperate point category, perhaps "snap points", that I can add extends button to instead of intersection_points. Intersection points are now more explicitly for handling intersections and deal with the addition and removal of shapes, etc, so non-intersection points should be removed to avoid side effects

- just noticed I've been using foreach wrong - fix any foreach loop that uses splice; this will skip the next element

Add multiple extend buttons if endpoint connected to multiple lines
Don't have extend option appear if line is already extended (I swear I used to check for this; must have accidentally removed the feature at some point)

right clicking extend button deletes it

Not 100% of intersection points are deleted when they should be, I can't figure out why right now. Maybe look at this again sometime with a fresh mindset
    - Pertains to line extensions

Tutotial/walkthrough for propositions

Experienced one-time bug where rulers weren't making intersection points unless extended. Bug went away on reload, but watch out for this

Label functionality

Maybe add label tool for manually labeling/relabeling things

Highlighted shape isn't always the one closest to the mouse for some reason

Make it so mouse proximity doesn't change with scale, so you can zoom in to get more precise/next to a proximity point

Add option so you can't add points and can only connect lines+compasses to existing points

I hit an infinite loop while adding a line somehow. I'm not sure why it came up, I think it has to do with intersection points but I haven't been able to replicate the conditions

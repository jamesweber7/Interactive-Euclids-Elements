I don't know what I want to do here, but I feel like I could definitely do something fun, idk
- Wordle for Greek letters - ωορδle? Ϝορδle? λέξηle or λέξηκle?
- Wordle with Linear B https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~crypto/Projects/ElizabethSmit/linear_b.html - neat but seems complicated.
- Olympic Games game somehow
- Minotaur's labyrinth
- Something to do with Greek math
- Greek gods
- Euclid's Elements Visualizations

For Proposition 2:
Need to 
1. extend a line in a direction
2. Get intersections between lines and arcs (and perhaps lines and lines)

TODO
- add seperate point category, perhaps "snap points", that I can add extends button to instead of intersection_points. Intersection points are now more explicitly for handling intersections and deal with the addition and removal of shapes, etc, so non-intersection points should be removed to avoid side effects

- just noticed I've been using foreach wrong - fix any foreach loop that uses splice; this will skip the next element

Add multiple extend buttons if endpoint connected to multiple lines
Don't have extend option appear if line is already extended (I swear I used to check for this; must have accidentally removed the feature at some point)

right clicking extend button deletes it

Eraser mode functionality

Tutotial/walkthrough for propositions
